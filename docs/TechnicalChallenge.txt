Technical Challenge: Autonomous Robot Logging with ROS 
Overview
Your task is to design and implement an experiment using ROS 2 where a simulated mobile robot autonomously navigates an environment and records key operational data. This data must be visualized, and selected events must also be recorded on a blockchain.
Objectives
    1. ROS Functionality
    • Use ROS 2 with Gazebo to simulate a mobile robot.
    • Implement autonomous navigation using a pre-defined map.
    • Record robot state data including:
        ◦ Timestamps
        ◦ Position coordinates (x, y)
        ◦ Status messages
    2. Experimental Design and Data Handling
    • Define a clear goal for the mobile robot. Please note that defining a single clear goal from the examples is sufficient. For example:
        ◦ Autonomously navigating three waypoints
        ◦ Completing an autonomous navigation loop around and indoor area
        ◦ Avoid obstacles and arrive at destination
    • Record relevant data during the experiment.
    • Use a clear methodology to describe the experiment and the expected behavior.
    3. Visualization
    • Plot figures that will elaborate on robot behavior and can confirm that the goal has been executed.
    4. Blockchain
    • Install and run Ganache to simulate a local Ethereum blockchain.
    • Write a simple Python script using web3.py to send transactions to Ganache.
    • Each time the robot executes the defined goal, submit a transaction that includes:
        ◦ A timestamp
        ◦ The robot’s position
        ◦ A brief status message (e.g. “Reached waypoint 2”)
    • Store this data in a smart contract or send it as a transaction payload.
Evaluation Criteria
The resultant code will be uploaded to a public GitHub repository. Together with the code a brief description of the experiment should be included. The evaluation criteria of this technical challenge will consider the following topics:
    • ROS navigation and system architecture
    • Experiment design and reproducibility
    • Logging, data collection and visualization
    • Blockchain setup and web3 integration
    • Possible improvements for future work
