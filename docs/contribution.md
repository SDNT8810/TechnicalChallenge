# Contributing

Keep it small and clear.

1. Branch from main.
2. Do the change.
3. Make sure `./run.sh` still works.
4. Open a PR explaining why.

Please don’t commit secrets. If you add dependencies, note them in the README.

Ideas welcome (multi‑robot, smart contract events, headless mode, etc.).
